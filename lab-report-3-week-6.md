## Streamlining ssh Configuration

○Show your .ssh/config file, and how you edited it (with VScode,
another program, etc)

○Show the ssh command logging you into your account using just
the alias you chose.

○Show an scp command copying a file to your account using just the
alias you chose.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6

○Show where the public key you made is stored on Github and in
your user account (screenshot).

○Show where the private key you made is stored on your user
account (but not its contents) as a screenshot.

○Show running git commands to commit and push a change to
Github while logged into your ieng6 account.

○Show a link for the resulting commit.

## Copy whole directories with scp -r

○Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6
account.

○Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling
and running the tests for your repository.

○Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and
ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.
