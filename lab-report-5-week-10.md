To run all the tests on the provided parser, I logged into ssh and then ran "bash script.sh" to run all the tests on the remote server, which outputed all the tests in this format:

For my own parser, I was able to run all the tests using the code I implemented in lab 9 which looks like this:

I have a print statement for the file name, as well as the returned links, which made it easy to navigate the output as I could see the file names:

Once I printed all the tests, I found two tests that had differing outputs.

This was an output from the provided parser:

And this was an output from my parser:
